# Scripts for Cryptologic Protocol Theory class
Project consists of scripts for Cryptologic Protocol Theory class. It's meant to support student's workflow through out the class.

# Scripts and their usage
## Elements of a group
* `elem.py <number_group>`

example: `elem.py 12` prints out elements of additive and multiplicative group Z12

## Greatest common divisor
* `gcd.py <a_number> <b_number>`

example: `gcd.py 9 7`

## Euler's totient function
* `phi.py <number>`

example: `phi.py 10`

# Requirements
In order to run above commands as shown you need to have installed [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) interpret and either be in current directory with scripts or have path to them set in system variable `$PATH` (on Windows)

# Tip
For faster workflow type only first few letters and press `TAB` key for auto-compltion. This way you never have to type ".py" at least.
